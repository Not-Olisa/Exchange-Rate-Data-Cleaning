# Exchange Rate Data Cleaning

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates the process of:
1. Scraping exchange rate data using Python.
2. Importing the data into Google Sheets.
3. Cleaning the dataset.
4. Creating a visualization of the top and worst currencies.

## Tools Used
- Python (for web scraping)
- Google Sheets (for data cleaning and visualization)

## Files
- `scraping.py` → Python script to scrape exchange rates.
- `exchange_rates_bs.csv - exchange_rates_bs.csv` → PDF of cleaned data and charts in Google Sheets.
- Google Sheets → [View Here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1nHtkpjA9faEIF8C4TmK-qEBGWIhwyX_xrqVErABpkTQ/edit?usp=sharing)

## Results
- Raw scraped exchange rates were imported into Google Sheets.
- A summary table of the **Top and Worst 10 Currencies by Exchange Rate** was created using `SORTN` function.
- A bar chart visualization highlights the top and worst currencies.

## Key Skills Demonstrated
- Data scraping with Python
- Data cleaning in Google Sheets
- Data visualization (charts, summary table)
- Clear documentation for reproducibility
